# XP264- Explore how to run cloud-native applications on SAP BTP, Kyma runtime

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session catalog number XP264 - [**Explore how to run cloud-native applications on SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.**](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1749035076180001oik0)  

  * Day-2 Operations: Maintenance, Monitoring, and Optimization
  * Onpremise connectivity

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to **Day-2** operation with SAP BTP, Kyma runtime - to help connect and extend enterprise applications in the cloud-native world.  

> SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime (SKR) is a managed offering of a Kubernetes Cluster based on Gardener, extended by set of building blocks called Kyma modules. The idea is that each instance of the Kyma runtime is a separate Kubernetes cluster with its own set of modules. Clusters are not shared between customers, and each customer has its own isolated environment. All instances are managed by a central Kyma Control Plane (KCP) that orchestrates the lifecycle of the underlying hyperscaler project, the Gardener Cluster, and the Kyma modules.

### During the session you will learn

  * how to run applications on the Kyma runtime for SAP BTP and discover the power of smooth integration with cloud applications and on-premise systems using the advanced connectivity features.  
  * to explore operational best practices from mastering troubleshooting techniques and intelligent root-cause analysis to event-driven autoscaling that adapts to your business needs in real time.
  * about multitenant application with SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are...

  * You need to have a GitHub user. If you don't have one so far, please sign-up on GitHub before going through the exercises
  * Additional configuration on your SAP TECHED 2025 Client laptop (that should be pre-installed)
    
  kubectl plugins | install [jq](https://jqlang.org/download/) | [Kyma CLI for SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud) |
  -- | -- | -- |
  install [krew.exe](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/releases/download/v0.4.5/krew.exe) | install jq with `winget install jqlang.jq` | install [kyma cli](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli/releases/download/3.2.0/kyma_Windows_x86_64.zip) 
  installing the oidc-login plugin | |
  install view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig plugin | |

  * Github actions (GHA). You may run the GHA-based exercises direclty from a browser on the laptop from your forked repository.  Alternatively, you may use VSCode terminal and other plugins you may be familiar with.

  * As this is a Day-2 operation brief, the entire cloud landscape has been pre-configured with a number of shared components like SAP Cloud Logging, SAP HANA Cloud and others.  
    * All the SAP Kyma environments have been configured to the same template (via terraform automation).  
    * Each SAP Kyma kubernetes cluster offers the same setup (with very minor differences)...

  * Last but not least, you will be able to *play* with a pre-deployed SAP Build multitenant application which follows BTP multitenancy paradigm.
