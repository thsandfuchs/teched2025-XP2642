# XP264- Explore how to run cloud-native applications on SAP BTP, Kyma runtime

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session catalog number XP264 - [**Explore how to run cloud-native applications on SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.**](https://url.sap/xuntr9)  

  * Day-2 Operations: Management, Maintenance, Monitoring, and Optimization
  * Technical connectivity to public and private (on-premise) systems 

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to **Day-2** operations with SAP BTP, Kyma runtime - a managed kubernetes environment to help connect and extend enterprise applications in the cloud-native world.

In a nutshell, SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime (SKR) is a managed runtime environment with a kubernetes cluster based on Gardener and a set of building blocks called Kyma modules.  

As a result, each instance of SAP BTP Kyma runtime environment is a single k8s gardener cluster with its own set of kyma modules.  

All these kubernetes clusters are managed by a central Kyma Control Plane (KCP) that orchestrates the lifecycle of 
 - the underlying hyperscaler (AWS/Azure/GCP) subscription (project), 
 - the Gardener Cluster, 
 - and the Kyma modules.

### During the session you will learn...

  * how to operate applications with SAP BTP, Kyma runtime and discover the power of smooth integration with cloud applications and on-premise systems using the advanced connectivity features.  
  * to explore operational best practices from mastering troubleshooting techniques and intelligent root-cause analysis to event-driven autoscaling that adapts to your business needs in real time.
  * about BTP multitenant applications with SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are...

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be able to fork the repository and activate the github actions at the fork. This is mandatory for this session!  
> Thus, you may need a GitHub user.  
> If you haven't got one yet, please [sign-up](exercises/ex0#exercise-00---sign-up-for-a-new-github-account) on GitHub before the workshop or at the very beginning of the session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The session content is provided *exclusively* on the SAP-Samples github, and many excercises have been implemented as CI/CD [Github Actions worflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions) (GHA). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The security is paramount!  
> With the Github Action IDP-delegated authentication flow, there is no more need to provide kubernetes and btp credentials when using the [github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/openid-connect#benefits-of-using-oidc). 
>  - ✅ The Github Action workflows acting as the [OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/openid-connect). 
>  - ✅ All the kubernetets environments in the landscape are configured to trust GitHub’s token identity provider. They come with the pre-configured OIDC applications leveraging the built-in Gardener OIDC shoot extension.
>  - ✅ SAP Cloud Identity Services acting as a platform IDP on the BTP side of the house has been federated with the Github actions OIDC Provider
>  - ✅ As a result, the very short-lived [credentials](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token) are being fetched and rotated automatically on the behalf of the repository user for both kubernetes and btp platform operations.

> [!WARNING]
> Personal devices ought not to be used for this session.
>
> - However, the good news is you may run the **GHA-based exercises** directly, from your [forked repository](
https://url.sap/h4ioc0), in the Chrome browser on the **provided** teched laptops.

> [!TIP]
> **Session directions.**  
>
> The session is pretty packed with content and information.  To make the best use of your time you may want to follow the below tips.  
> - 👉 Run and take time to inspect the results of the built-in automations. Ask questions. And if you feel like doing, go ahead and create your own variants as well.
> - 👉 The recommendation is, however, to go with the mere flow of the exercises and leave the rest for homework.
>
> - For any exercise which may require a terminal use, you may use the VSCode integrated terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> - As this is the Day-2 operation brief, the entire cloud landscape has been pre-configured with a number of shared components, namely:  
>   - 🔗 SAP Cloud Identity Services (SAP IAS)  
>   - 🔗 SAP Cloud Logging  
>   - 🔗 SAP HANA Cloud  
>   - 🔗 ArgoCDaaS  
>   - 🔗 SAP BTP Connectivity services - Destination service, Connectivity service, Cloud Connector, Connectivity Proxy and Transparent Proxy  
>   - 🔗 S4/HANA On-premise (private cloud) with the Cloud Connector in the private network.  
>
> - All of the SAP Kyma environments have been configured to the same template (via terraform automation).  
>
> - Last but not least, you will be able to *play* with a SAP Build multi-tenant application pre-deployed to one of the kyma provider clusters.   

- :notebook: FYI: There are several additional command line tools available on your SAP TECHED 2025 Client laptops, namely:  
    
  - kubectl plugin list
    ```
    The following compatible plugins are available:

    C:\Software\CLI\Kubernetes\kubectl-convert.exe
    C:\Users\TE-06\.krew\bin\kubectl-krew.exe
    C:\Users\TE-06\.krew\bin\kubectl-oidc_login.exe
    C:\Users\TE-06\.krew\bin\kubectl-resource_capacity.exe
    C:\Users\TE-06\.krew\bin\kubectl-view_serviceaccount_kubeconfig.exe 
    ``` 
  - jq, curl, [kyma cli](https://url.sap/ottdcc), terraform, etc.
