# XP264- Explore how to run cloud-native applications on SAP BTP, Kyma runtime

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session catalog number XP264 - [**Explore how to run cloud-native applications on SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.**](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1749035076180001oik0)  

  * Day-2 Operations: Maintenance, Monitoring, and Optimization
  * On-premise connectivity

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to **Day-2** operations with SAP BTP, Kyma runtime - a managed kubernetes environment to help connect and extend enterprise applications in the cloud-native world.  

In a nutshell, SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime (SKR) is a managed offering of a Kubernetes Cluster based on Gardener, extended by a set of building blocks called **Kyma modules**.  
The idea being that each instance of SAP BTP Kyma runtime environment is a separate Kubernetes cluster with its own set of modules.  
All these clusters are managed by a central Kyma Control Plane (KCP) that orchestrates the lifecycle of 
 - the underlying hyperscaler project, 
 - the Gardener Cluster, 
 - and the Kyma modules.

### During the session you will learn

  * how to operate applications with SAP BTP, Kyma runtime and discover the power of smooth integration with cloud applications and on-premise systems using the advanced connectivity features.  
  * to explore operational best practices from mastering troubleshooting techniques and intelligent root-cause analysis to event-driven autoscaling that adapts to your business needs in real time.
  * about multitenant applications with SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are...

  * You need to have a GitHub user. If you don't have one so far, please sign-up on GitHub before going through the exercises
  * Additional software tools on your SAP TECHED 2025 Client laptop (that should be already pre-installed)
    
  kubectl plugins | install [jq](https://jqlang.org/download/) | [Kyma CLI for SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud) |
  -- | -- | -- |
  install [krew.exe](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/releases/download/v0.4.5/krew.exe) | install jq with `winget install jqlang.jq` | install [kyma cli](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli/releases/download/3.2.0/kyma_Windows_x86_64.zip) 
  installing the oidc-login plugin | |
  install view-serviceaccount-kubeconfig plugin | |

  * Github actions (GHA). You may run the GHA-based exercises direclty from a browser on the laptop from your forked repository.  
  * Alternatively, you may use VSCode on your teched laptop terminal and other plugins you may be familiar with.

  * As this is a Day-2 operation brief, the entire cloud landscape has been pre-configured with a number of shared components, for instance: 
   - SAP Cloud Identity Services (SAP IAS), 
   - SAP Cloud Logging, 
   - SAP HANA Cloud,
   - ArgoCDaaS,
   - BTP Connectivity services,
   - S4/HANA On-premise (private cloud) with SAP Cloud Connector in the private network.

  * All the SAP Kyma environments have been configured to the same template (via terraform automation).  


  * Last but not least, you will be able to *play* with a pre-deployed SAP Build multitenant application which follows BTP multitenancy paradigm.
