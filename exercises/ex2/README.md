# Exercise 2 - Use External Scalers. Keda - the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaler.

## Exercise 2.0 - Introduction to kubernetes autoscalers

> [!NOTE]
>
> KEDA, an open-source initiative that facilitates event-driven autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads, was originally developed by Microsoft and Red Hat. It has since become a sandbox project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). KEDA focuses on autoscaling applications in response to events sourced from a variety of platforms, including Kafka, RabbitMQ, and cloud-specific services such as Azure Service Bus and Google Pub/Sub.

> [!NOTE]
>
> KEDA ushers in a new era of flexibility and efficiency in autoscaling. It enhances Kubernetes' capacity to support fine-grained autoscaling for event-driven workloads. Leveraging KEDA, you can dynamically scale your deployments from zero to any arbitrary number, contingent on the volume of events they are designed to process.



> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pre-requisites:
> - A dedicated Python Function is provided, in every single student namespace, with the replicas value set to 1 to prevent the internal Serverless HPA creation.
> 👉 Run the provided github actions workflows to experience HPA and KEDA inspect the workflow run log.

A dedicated load generator to be run in a separate browser window...  
- 👉 run the `k8s-hpa-keda-load-generator` workflow
- 👉 For the best experience, open the workflow link into into a new window (right click).

PS. The below steps are for illustration only. 

- step1: nitially deployed serveless python 3.12 function with a single replica....
- step2: Scale-out to 3 or 5 replicas 
- step3: After a little while the HPA will be up and running:  
- step4: scale down from 5 to 2 replicas 
- step5: scale back to a single replica.

## Exercise 2.1 - HPA

- 👉 run the `k8s-hpa-student` workflow
- 👉 inspect the `k8s-hpa-student` workflow run log
- 👉 For the best experience, open workflow links into a separate tab or into a new window (right click).

## Exercise 2.2 - KEDA

- 👉 run the `k8s-keda-student` workflow
- 👉 inspect the `k8s-keda-student` workflow run log
- 👉 For the best experience, open workflow links into a separate tab or into a new window (right click).

## Exercise 2.3 - KEDA's Cron-Based Scaler

- 👉 run the `k8s-keda-cron-student` workflow
- 👉 inspect the `k8s-keda-cron-student` workflow run log
- 👉 For the best experience, open workflow links into a separate tab or into a new window (right click).

KEDA offers a broad range of scaling strategies, one of which is the **cron-based scaler**. This scaler allows you to schedule scaling actions according to the time of day, an invaluable feature for managing predictable fluctuations in workload.

As an illustration, the cron-based scaler enables you to:

- **Manage High Traffic and Request Volume Peaks**: With the cron-based scaler, you can program your applications to upscale during peak hours or high-traffic events, such as Black Friday or New Year sales. The same functionality can be used to schedule your applications to upscale during off-peak hours for batch processing tasks.

</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

- **Optimize Resource Utilization and Reduce Expenses**: The cron-based scaler offers a solution to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs by allowing you to schedule your applications to downscale during non-working hours. This feature is useful for your **dev/stage/QA** clusters, which are not required during off-working hours.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This benefits when your workloads require more resources than the base setup. The [current base setup](https://kyma-project.github.io/price-calculator/) consists of 3 VMs, each with 4 CPU and 16 GB of RAM. Therefore, if your workloads need 4 or more VMs to be provisioned, this feature can provide benefits to control costs and keep them to base setup during off-work hours.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The cron scheduling is applicable only to customer workloads and **not to kyma components**.
