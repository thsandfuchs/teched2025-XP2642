# Exercise 1 - First things first. Day-2 with SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime

Day 2 Operations refers to the ongoing operational activities required to maintain, monitor, and optimize systems after the initial deployment (Day 1 - Configuration and Deployment).

## Exercise 1.2 - Built-in github actions automation flows

Does one always need to climb the mountain of the onboarding documentation? Not necessarily.  
A well-thought and designed landscape (Day-0/Day-1) would offer some built-in automation.  
Good to know:  
- This landscape features a number of pre-configured CI/CD github action workflows and Terraform automations.
- The workflows templates have been automatically generated by the Day-1 landscape
- The Day-2 teams have a solid set of automated worfklows to build upon their Day-2/SRE operationas

In this exercise you will:  
- 👉 Explore Kyma runtime environments with the built-in automation flows.  
- 👉 Retrieve the key information about the state of the runtime environment... at a glance.  
- 👉 Both securely and effortlessly!


The pre-configured CI/CD automation workflows are to be manually triggered. 
They come in three different flavors, namely as:
* admin workflows (cluster-wide) 
* students workflows (namespaced)   
* data collection workflows (namespaced).

Explanation. What has happened?
----------
- You have manually triggered the pre-configured CI/CD automation workflows.
- Workflows execution is divided into steps. Each step represents a dedicated task.
- Diagnostic data collection from kyma clusters is done using both Kyma CLI and with several Terraform providers, namely:
  * SAP BTP TF provider
  * kubernetes provider 
  * kubectl provider

👉 Inspect the steps of each of the worklow you have run, for instance:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Good to know:
> - The security is paramount!  
> - The automated workflows leverage the dynamic OIDC credentials with Github Actions acting as the OIDC token provider in the context of a running job.  
> - Thus, there is no need to have any static credentials or be compelled to use a vault.  
> - The implemented mechanism ensures the credentials are rotated automatically which makes it suitable for long running pipelines as well.  


> [!NOTE]
> **In a nutshell, the automation workflow offer the following features and benefits:**
>
>  - 🔐 built-in GitHub's OIDC token trust for secure authentication
>  - ⚙️ easy setup of your Kubernetes kubeconfig with a single or multiple cluster contexts
>  - 🚀 can run kubectl and helm commands in your workflow
>  - 🚀 can run kyma cli commands in your workflow
>  - 🚀 can run terraform automation flows in your workflow
>
> **Benefits:**
>
>  - ✅ No need to store Kubernetes credentials as secrets
>  - ✅ Enhanced security through short-lived tokens
>  - ✅ Automatic token rotation
>  - ✅ Fine-grained access control

## Exercise 1.3 - Zoom on Kyma CLI (optional)

In a nutshell, Kyma CLI extends the capabilities of the ubiquitous kubectl CLI against a range of kyma specific features.  

> [!TIP]
> Good to know: 
> - It is already pre-installed on the teched laptops and can be used from either a terminal window or VSCode integrated terminal
> - It is also available out-of-the-box in the automation workflows prepared for this session.
> - It is available for [installation](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-kyma-cli) in the github CI/CD pipelines from the [github actions marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?query=kyma).  

> [!NOTE]
>
> 👉 run `kyma version`
> 
> ```
> Kyma-CLI Version: 3.2.0
> ```
>
> 👉 run `kyma -h`
> ~~~rust
> kyma -h     
> Use this command to manage Kyma modules and resources on a cluster.
>
> Usage:
>  kyma [command]
>
> Available Commands:
>  alpha       Groups command prototypes for which the API may still change
>  app         Manages applications on the Kubernetes cluster
>  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
>  function    A set of commands for managing Functions
>  help        Help about any command
>  module      Manages Kyma modules
>  version     Displays the version of Kyma CLI
>
> Flags:
>  -h, --help                    Help for the command
>      --kubeconfig string       Path to the Kyma kubeconfig file
>      --show-extensions-error   Prints a possible error when fetching extensions fails
>      --skip-extensions         Skip fetching extensions from the target Kyma environment
>
> Use "kyma [command] --help" for more information about a command.
> ~~~

Practice:

> [!NOTE]
> - 👉 Let's leverage the kyma cli to get simple metadata from a kyma cluster...  
> - 👉 run `kyma alpha diagnose -f json | jq '.metadata'`
>
> ~~~rust
> {
>  "globalAccountID": "4c526f8b-cca9-4837-8b43-87824e3a4d10",
>  "subaccountID": "5524c764-8893-4530-8eb8-feb9e6110f16",
> ............
> }
> ~~~
> Practice:
> - 👉 run and explore `kyma alpha diagnose -f json | jq '.nodes[] | tojson'`

> [!TIP]
>  * Let's use the above information to build the deep link to the BTP subaccount with the kyma runtime environment.  
>  * Use the link to inspect the BTP side of the kyma house....
>  * Goto the [landscape dashboard](https://url.sap/3kf0ol) and choose the right environment...
>  * Scramble the kyma runtime environment with the BTP Provisioning Service REST APIs


- 👉 Last but not least, get familiar with the other *kyma cli* [commands](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli/tree/3.2.0/docs/user/gen-docs)... 

## Exercise 1.4 - Fire-fighter access to your kyma cluster

As usual, in case of fire, one needs well designated escape routes!  

There are mutliple ways to gain access to a kyma cluster in XP264 session landscape, namely:
- from a kyma dashboard (console)
- from a terminal window using the downloaded user OIDC kubeconfig with either `kubectl` and/or `kyma CLI`
- from within a github action diagnostic workflow that comprises the embeded terraform automation (the preferred way)


The first two methods require a kubectl oidc plugin and cannot be performed in a headless context, for instance in a CI/CD pipeline or workflow.  

<!-- > [!NOTE]
>
> * For convenience, here goes the table with the links to all btp and k8s resources...  
> * You can initially download the kubeconfig from one of the links below or directly from any SAP Kyma dashboard.

 -->

> [!TIP]
> 
> - Relying on a user-OIDC kubeconfig is not very convenient due to the periodic redirects that may cause timeouts, even if used in a terminal window.
